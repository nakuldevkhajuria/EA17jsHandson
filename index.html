Question 6: Whatâ€™s the difference between window vs document?
<pre>
    In a web browser, the window object represents the current browser window, and the document object
     represents the HTML document that is displayed in the window.

The window object is a global object in JavaScript, and it provides access to many properties and methods 
that are related to the current window, such as the innerWidth and innerHeight properties, which give the 
width and height of the window's content area, and the open() and close() methods, which can be used to open
 and close new windows.

The document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in the current window. It provides access
 to the structure and content of the document, as well as methods for manipulating the document. For 
 example, the document.getElementById() method can be used to retrieve a specific element from the document
  by its ID, and the document.createElement() method can be used to create new elements and add them to the
   document.

In general, the window object represents the browser window itself, while the document object represents the 
contents of the window, which is typically an HTML document.
